Problem Statement No. 38 - Improved Source of Drinking Water
The Challenge: Access to safe and improved sources of drinking water remains a 
critical issue in India, especially in rural and underdeveloped regions. Despite ongoing 
efforts under the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), inequalities persist in water 
accessibility across states and socio-economic groups. This project aims to analyze 
data from the 78th Round of the Multiple Indicator Survey (MIS) to assess the 
percentage of the population with access to improved drinking water sources. It will also 
explore related indicators such as use of clean cooking fuel and migration trends. By 
identifying patterns and disparities, the study will generate actionable insights to support 
evidence-based policymaking. The ultimate goal is to help ensure equitable access to 
clean water and contribute to India's progress on SDG targets.
